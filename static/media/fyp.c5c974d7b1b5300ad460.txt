Introduction

Trade shows, or 'trade fairs', can be quite large and overwhelming events, where it may be a visitor's first time at the location. Finding your way around and deciding where to visit can be confusing. 

Objective

The goal of this project was to design and implement a system which can help guide visitors to points of interest at such events. This project involved the frontend development of a website, creating a multi-platform mobile application, and a backend server to interact with both.  It implemented the idea of using wireless devices, such as Bluetooth Beacons, to help identify locations on a map and guide users to nearby interest points. It also plans suggested routes for a user to follow based on their interests. 

Visitors to the Open Day are encouraged to download the app to help guide them around the building and find projects that they are interested in.
